- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mrhamm,
I have studied Theoretical Cosmology, Differential Geometry, and Dark Matter Physics for my Ph.D. 
(See my arXiv profile at: https://arxiv.org/search/?query=benjamin+hamm&searchtype=author&source=header) 
My primary experience in coding has been in numerical and computational methods with a specific focus on 
systems of non-linear differential equations and how they can be used to model the physics of Dark Matter in galaxies.

Recently, I have taken an interest in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.  I find the concepts
of decentralization and decentralized programming to be fascinating and exciting.  Moreover, blockchain's
growing role in the financial and political worlds should not be ignored.  As a physicist, I enjoy problem 
solving - the new and rapidly growing blockchain ecosystem has the potential to solve important problems 
that affect our every day lives.  


This github profile serves as a documentation of my pubilcly available scripts.  My primary experience
is in Python, though I am quite familiar with Matlab, R, SQL and html.
